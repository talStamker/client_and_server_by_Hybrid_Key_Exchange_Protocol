Suppose you get a list of words a_list. For each word, you need to identify if it starts with the letter b.
If so, the word should be changed so that it starts with an uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters, and
Save the corrected words (and only them) in b_list.
Solution:
I set a_list to an example of input.
b_list-I set to empty list.
In for I check if the word is'nt empty for know if in word[0] there is something.
If the word is empty I do'nt need it and if not i want check if in word[0] there is b and I know I can call it because there is something in it.
